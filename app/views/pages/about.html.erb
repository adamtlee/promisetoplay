<h3>
    Mission statement
</h3>
<p>
    Early prevention awareness and healthy lifestyle promotion is the key to reducing disease and illness. I Promise to Play Every Day will be a one day event
    that will bring kids outside for opportunities to learn about the importance of nutrition and daily exercise as well as a chance to win fun prizes that
    will keep them active.
</p>
<p>
    Think Tank Student Organization of the Honors Program focuses on addressing issues in the community through sustainable changes. The issue being addressed
    with this service project is the high rate of obesity, specifically in the Denver Public School district. By raising awareness among the students and their
    parents, we hope to encourage physical activity and mindfulness of nutrition.
